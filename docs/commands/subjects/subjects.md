# Subjects
This file will give you an introduction to some of the subject commands.

### Joining a subject
To join a subject use: `iq join <subject>` where *<subject>* is the subject. For example: `iq join math` will join the math subject.

### Getting asked a question
If you want a question use: `iq <subject>` where *<subject>* is the subject. Please note that you'll have to join a subject before you run this command.
From the last example where I explained how to join a subject. You can run: `iq math` to get a math question.

### Answering a question
To answer a question is fairly simple. Just use: `iq answer <answer>` where *<answer>* is the answer to the question you just got asked. Please note this requires you to get a questions beforehand.
